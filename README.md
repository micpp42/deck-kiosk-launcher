# deck-kiosk-launcher
A decker-based launcher for my Deck Kiosk project

The Deck Kiosk is basically a project I have to make a standalone machine based on a raspberry pi for running stuff made for Internet Janitor's excellent [Decker](github.com/JohnEarnest/Decker) platform. Initially I was just using the default raspbian desktop to launch stuff but a few new features in Decker allowed me to make a launcher IN decker itself. So that's this!

It's basically provided here "as is", a lot of it is specific to how I've got stuff set up, but it should hopefully make enough sense if you want to build something similar. One thing to note is that this only works in Native Decker and requires a "danger zone" build.
